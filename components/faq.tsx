  {
    question: "How does the client tier system work?",
    answer:
      "Tiers are calculated automatically based on session price, training frequency, and payment model. Diamond clients score highest across all three factors, followed by Gold and Silver. You can't manually set tiers — the system keeps it objective.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I import my existing clients?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can add clients manually or we can help you bulk-import from a CSV. Each client profile stores contact info, goals, health conditions, session pricing, and attendance history.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my client data secure?",
    answer:
      "All data is stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL) with row-level security enabled — only you can access your clients. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We never sell or share your data with third parties.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I reach my client limit on the Free plan?",
    answer:
      "The Free plan supports up to 5 active clients. When you hit the limit, you'll be prompted to upgrade to Professional or higher to add more. Your existing clients and data are never removed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    answer:
      "Yes, absolutely. You can cancel your subscription at any time from the Settings page. You'll keep access until the end of your current billing period, and your data remains available for 30 days after cancellation.",
